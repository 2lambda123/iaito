## Environment Details

Despite we only fix issues reproducible in git-master branch, it's fine to report issues found in releases. And those will be closed when a new release comes out.

```sh
# copypaste this script into your shell and replace it with the output
iaito -v
date
r2 -v
uname -ms
```

## Description

<!-- Explain what's the issue, how to repro and what you expect, we love screenshots -->
