# Contributing to iaito

Iaito is not in active development, the current focus of the project is in simplicity, reduce
tech debt by removing superfluous, anoying or mainly unused dependencies like python support
or plugins, breakpad, the cmake build system, crash reports or auto-updates features, as long as
the project is under low maintainance mode is good to remove stuff that distract the attention
from the core which is the one that should be handling all that stuff. Iaito focus on exposing
the capabilities of r2 instead of duplicating efforts in a GUI.
