## Submit a Pull Request

Note that cutter is still under development and many parts of the code are to be improved.
The best way is to check the opened issues [here](https://github.com/radareorg/iaito/issues) or discuss with radareorg team.
Please follow our contribution guidelines: https://cutter.re/docs/contributing.html

## Write Some Documentation

The documentation is something important for newcomers. As of today the documentation can be found [here](https://cutter.re/docs/) and it stands in the [docs](https://github.com/radareorg/iaito/tree/master/docs) folder.
The API Reference is automatically generated from the source code, so it is strongly advised to document your code.
Check issues marked as "Documentation" on our issues [list](https://github.com/radareorg/iaito/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ADocumentation).

## Translations

You can help Iaito by adding translations to the project! We use the [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/iaito) platform to help us share translations. Feel free to contribute and add translations to the project. If you need to add a language, ask any radareorg developer.
